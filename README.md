# IWA4

Why did the original code not work?
missing closing bracket, colon used instead of equals sign for assigning value to variables, const was used instead of let which meant you could not change variable value after var decalred as const globally. Student declared initially instead of parent as per the challenge brief, "status" used as a variabe name which gave a deprecated error.
